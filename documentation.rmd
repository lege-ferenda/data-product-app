The Europe 2020 strategy puts forward three mutually reinforcing 
priorities to make the EU a smarter, more sustainable and more inclusive economy.
Member states have to meet certain quantifiable goals in key policy sectors such as
the labour market and the field of research. 

In this shiny-app you can generate a plot in order to visualize the data taken directly from 
Eurostat database, making use of the extremely useful "Eurostat" Package.
First you have to choose the sector, i.e Employment Rate or Research and then you have to choose a 
specific member state.

For the Employment rate, the scale of the X-axis is the percentage of the employment rate for both 
genders. In respect to Reseach sector, the x-axis scale represents the percent of GDP invested in 
research projects.

The horizontal line in the plot, indicates the level that should be reached by 2020.

Have fun!
